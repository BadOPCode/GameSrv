GameSrv BBS Door Game Server
============================

This is the source to the new C# rewrite of the GameSrv BBS Door Game Server.<br />
The old Delphi version can still be found on SourceForce at http://www.sf.net/projects/rm-gamesrv, but it is no longer maintained (and hasn't been for some time).<br />
<br />
You'll also need to fork RMLib and RMLibUI in order to compile this project.  They haven't been pushed to GitHub yet, but should follow in the next few days.

The official GameSrv website can be found at http://www.gamesrv.ca/
